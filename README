An ant task that reads cobertura (http://cobertura.sourceforge.net) test coverage data and outputs a crap4j (http://www.crap4j.org) metric report.

Read more about the motivation and background information at (LINK TO BLOG ENTRY)

= Basic usage =
1. Define the task in your ant script
2. Use the task, feeding it the cobertura XML report file and your .class files, pointing to an output/target directory

== Details for 1. ==
- Include this into your ant script and set ${crapertura.home} to your crapertura installation directory

<taskdef name="crapertura" classname="com.schneide.crapertura.ant.CraperturaTask">
	<classpath>
		<fileset dir="${crapertura.home}">
			<include name="**/*.jar" />
		</fileset>
	</classpath>
</taskdef>

== Details for 2. ==
- Include this into your ant script and set the parameters.
- ${cobertura.report.file} has to point to the XML report file of cobertura
- ${crapertura.report.directory} has to point to the output directory for the crap4j-like result report
- ${classes.directory} has to point to your compiled, but unpackaged class files (.class)

<crapertura
	coberturaReportFile="${cobertura.report.file}"
	targetDirectory="${crapertura.report.directory}"
	classesDirectory="${classes.directory}"
/>

= Advanced usage =
There are at least two optional parameters provided for advanced users:
- generateHTMLReport (true/false): If false, will not generate the HTML report, but the crap4j XML file only. Defaults to true.
- crapThreshold (0..MAX_INTEGER): Adjusts the crap threshold of the analysis to the given value. Defaults to 30. See also http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html

= Building for yourself =
- The project is developed with Eclipse (3.6). Just import it and run the build.xml ant script.
- The deployable artifact can be found in the subdirectory "dist".
- You can also run build.xml with ant from the command line.

Enjoy and share your experience!
