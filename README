= Basic usage =
1. Define the task in your ant script
2. Use the task, feeding it the cobertura XML report file and your .class files, pointing to an output/target directory

== Details for 1. ==
- Include this into your ant script and set ${crapertura.home} to your crapertura installation directory

<taskdef name="crapertura" classname="com.schneide.crapertura.ant.CraperturaTask">
	<classpath>
		<fileset dir="${crapertura.home}">
			<include name="**/*.jar" />
		</fileset>
	</classpath>
</taskdef>

== Details for 2. ==
- Include this into your ant script and set the parameters.
- ${cobertura.report.file} has to point to the XML report file of cobertura
- ${crapertura.report.directory} has to point to the output directory for the crap4j-like result report
- ${classes.directory} has to point to your compiled, but unpackaged class files (.class)

<crapertura
	coberturaReportFile="${cobertura.report.file}"
	targetDirectory="${crapertura.report.directory}"
	classesDirectory="${classes.directory}"
/>

= Advanced usage =
There are at least two optional parameters provided for advanced users:
- generateHTMLReport (true/false): If false, will not generate the HTML report, but the crap4j XML file only. Defaults to true.
- crapThreshold (0..MAX_INTEGER): Adjusts the crap threshold of the analysis to the given value. Defaults to 30. See also http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html
